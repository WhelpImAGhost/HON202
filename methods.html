				<p class="columnsplit2">4.	Method and Design
					a.	Methods
						i.	Large-scale questionnaire for Portland
							1.	Initial small questionnaire to get sum of questions
							2.	Larger questionnaire to follow with more specific questions
							3.	Question teens and adults around Portland
								a.	Ask if they regularly use trimet
								b.	Ask if they have a car, etc
							4.	Good for getting general idea of Portland 
							5.	Children will not be included in the survey
						ii.	Possible interviews / quotes from BSS/ESS companies
							1.	Get information about their recycling and repairability process
							2.	Understand more about their sustainability
					b.	Design
						i.	If overwhelming evidence suggests the lack of use of BSS/ESS, it can be concluded that they will be more wasteful than productive
						ii.	If overwhelming evidence suggests adequate use of the BSS/ESS, then the hypothesis will be false.
						iii.	However, both will be made near irrelevant if an interview with the companies shows they are not recycling or repairing their products and instead trashing them
						iv.	The conclusions made in this research can be presented back to the companies and/or to various Right to Repair movement groups, depending on the outcome. 
							1.	Right to Repair movements will use any information they can to support their cause for more Right to Repair acts and bills.
							2.	If a company is not making sufficient movements for sustainability or repairability, this research can aid in pushing for more sustainable and repairable products
					c.	Procedure
						i.	  Small questionnaire
						ii.	Larger questionnaire
							1.	Participants will fill out an online questionnaire, answering truthfully to as many as they can.
						iii.	Interviews with companies
							1.	Gather information about their processes for repair and sustainability
						iv.	Organize data and find patterns
					d.	Analysis]
						i.	Data will be analyzed based on the more popular answers from the questions.
						ii.	Hypothesis will be confirmed if the data leads towards the products being e-waste or not practical, or the company not being sustainable or repairable
						iii.	Hypothesis will be disconfirmed if the data suggests that the product is adequately used, the company is sustainable, and neither are leaning more towards e-waste.
