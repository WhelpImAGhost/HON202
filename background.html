				<p>2. Background Information
						a.	Information already in field
							i.	“Much of the literature related to micromobility studies has focused on docked bikesharing, with comparatively little research on dockless BSS and even scarcer investigations into ESS systems.”(Blaznin et al., 2021).
							ii.	Not much information has been gathered regarding these scooters and bikes
							iii.	Many people do not know how to share the road with cars or pedestrians
								1.	“This is particularly so because many users of ESS/BSS (66% of users according to the Portland Bureau of Transportation, 2018) are not aware of their obligations when sharing the road with other vehicles and pedestrians.”(Blaznin et al., 2021)
							iv.	Many cities are already implementing fleets of these ESS/BSS vehicles around the US. 
							v.	Scooters are more of a pollutant than other means of transport, unless the scooter has a long use life (Hollingsworth et al., 2019)
						b.	Why these studies are insufficient / what else needs to be studied
							i.	Neither article cited above suggests that the BSS/ESS programs are worth their added carbon footprint or their cost
